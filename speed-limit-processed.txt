edmonton-journal Coun. Andrew Knack also asked council to vote on reducing the limit on main streets and high pedestrian areas, like Whyte Avenue and Jasper Avenue.

edmonton-journal Knack had pushed for 30 km/h in core.

edmonton-journal "At this point, there's really no denying the fact that a 30 km/h speed limit is the right speed in terms of reducing injuries and death," Knack said before the vote. "This speed has the greatest overall benefit for safety." 

edmonton-journal Coun. Sarah Hamilton proposed a blanket 40 km/h in all residential areas, noting that council has been debating options for several years. 

edmonton-journal Interim city manager Adam Laughlin noted that city administration supports reducing the 50 km/h limit in residential areas, but not going as far as 30 km/h.

edmonton-journal "Our recommendation, despite what's on the motion, is 40 km/h across the city," Laughlin told council. "I think what we'd really appreciate is a decision so that we can forward." 

edmonton-journal Knack said the first suggestion to lower the 50 km/h limit was made about a decade ago.

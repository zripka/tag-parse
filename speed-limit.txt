Motorists will be required to slow down to 40 km/h on all residential streets after city council voted on the drawn-out issue during a meeting Wednesday. 

Council also agreed to lower the limit to 40 km/h on main streets such as Jasper Avenue and Whyte Avenue.

The new speed is expected to be in place by mid-2021, after the necessary bylaw changes have been made.

Residential roads are currently 50 km/h by default, except in designated playground zones, which are 30 km/h. 

Councillors voted 8-5 in favour of the 40 km/h limit in both core and suburban neighbourhoods.

@Coun. Andrew Knack also asked council to vote on reducing the limit on main streets and high pedestrian areas, like Whyte Avenue and Jasper Avenue.~

That was also supported by an 8-5 vote.

@Knack had pushed for 30 km/h in core.~

@"At this point, there's really no denying the fact that a 30 km/h speed limit is the right speed in terms of reducing injuries and death," Knack said before the vote. "This speed has the greatest overall benefit for safety." ~

@Coun. Sarah Hamilton proposed a blanket 40 km/h in all residential areas, noting that council has been debating options for several years. ~

"How long have we been talking about this?" she asked during the meeting. 

@Interim city manager Adam Laughlin noted that city administration supports reducing the 50 km/h limit in residential areas, but not going as far as 30 km/h.~

@"Our recommendation, despite what's on the motion, is 40 km/h across the city," Laughlin told council. "I think what we'd really appreciate is a decision so that we can forward." ~

@Knack said the first suggestion to lower the 50 km/h limit was made about a decade ago.~
